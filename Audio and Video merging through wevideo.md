# Audio and Video merging through a wevideo

### To Merge Audio and Video through a wevideo, follow these steps:

* Insert the video and audio files that you want to use in your project into your WeVideo media library, either by uploading them from your computer or by selecting them from your existing media library.

* Create a new project in WeVideo by clicking on the "Create New Video" button.

* Select the video file that you want to use in your project from your media library and add it to the timeline.

* Mute the original audio of the video by clicking on the audio icon in the timeline and dragging the volume slider to zero.

* Select the audio file that you want to superimpose on the video and add it to the timeline. Make sure that the audio file starts at the same time as the video file.

* Adjust the volume levels of the video and audio files so that they blend well together. You can do this by clicking on the audio icon in the timeline and adjusting the volume slider.

* Once you are happy with the final result, click on the "Finish" button and export your video in your desired format.
