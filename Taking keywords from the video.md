# Taking keywords from the video


## Here are some steps you can follow to take keywords from a video:

*  Review the PPT slides and take note of the most important points
    
*  Compare the keywords and phrases you identified in the PPT slides with the ones from the transcript. Look for matches
    
*  Prioritize the keywords and phrases that are mentioned in both the PPT slides and the transcript, as these are likely to be the most important
    
*  Refine your list of keywords and phrases based on their relevance and importance to the main topics or themes of the presentation
