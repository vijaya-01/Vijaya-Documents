Step 1: Get the Project ID Visit our team's centralized hub at rebrand.ly/teamlinks and locate the all-component-trackers file. This file contains the Project ID needed for this project.

Step 2: Start Sprint-Prep Let's get the ball rolling! Begin by initiating the sprint-prep process.

Step 3: Create Project Folders Create a dedicated folder for this project with the Project ID as its name. Within this folder, create subfolders for the project-tracker and component-trackers. It's important to keep all trackers organized in one place.

Step 4: Copy the Template Duplicate the template-for-project-tracking-v11 and name it with the Project ID followed by "-project-tracker-v11". Move this new file to the correct folder.

Step 5: Extract Course Information Gather the section name and lesson names of the course, but hold off on assigning component names for now.

Step 6: Architect Approval Send the extracted components to our Architect for approval or rejection. Wait until we hear back from them.

Step 7: Component IDs Once the Architect has approved the selected components, assign unique component IDs to each one.

Step 8: Upload Videos Download the approved videos from the source and upload them to Vimeo. This step is crucial for content delivery!

Step 9: Complete Screenshots Create screenshots for each video, taking care to include all necessary details.

Step 10: Prepare Sprint-Prep Checklist Before submitting, prepare a detailed checklist for the sprint-prep process.

Step 11: Submit for Approval Submit your completed estimates for approval.

Step 12: Create Component Tracker Sheets Create individual tracker sheets for each component, and don't forget to change the ownership to [ncddraq@gmail.com](mailto:ncddraq@gmail.com). Make sure to give [jopfscdm1@gmail.com](mailto:jopfscdm1@gmail.com) and [jopfscdm2@gmail.com](mailto:jopfscdm2@gmail.com) edit access.

Step 13: Create PowerPoint Presentations Create PowerPoint presentations for each component, with separate slides for screenshots, marking, and animation. Make sure to save each file under its component ID.
