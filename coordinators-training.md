__ **DOCUMENT FOR COORDINATOR TRAINING _**_
  
**Step 1**
-   Download source videos from other websites.
-   Use Online Video Cutter to divide the sprints based on 1 hour content.
-   Change the video title to (projectname)(sprintname).
-   Upload the divided videos to Vimeo - Video Experience Platform http://vimeo.com/

**Step 2** 
  
To create a project tracker for updating the content and status of the project, please follow the steps below:

-  Select the "template-for-project-tracking-V7" sheet and make a copy of it.
-  Rename the copied sheet to <projectname>.
-  Open the sheet and update the content in all the columns of subsheet ZZ, such as component ID's, entry date, priority, source video title, source video URL, etc.
-  Enter the component ID's correctly in all the sheets from AA to GG.
-  Copy the video URL's from ZZ and paste them in the appropriate cells of AA, BB, and CC sheets.
-  Enter all the PPT URL's in the appropriate cells of AA, BB, CC, FF, and GG sheets.
-  Create individual tracker sheets for components and add them to the main tracker sheet wherever necessary (CC, DD, EE, FF, GG).
-  Make sure to give ownership of all tracker sheets to "[ncddraq@gmail.com](mailto:ncddraq@gmail.com)" and edit access to "[ncdcdm1@gmail.com](mailto:ncdcdm1@gmail.com)".

**Step 3**
-   We will send you a tracker folder to your email ID.
-   Open the folder and create a main tracker sheet and individual tracker sheets for each component ID.
-   Change the ownership of all tracker sheets to "[ncdcdm1@gmail.com](mailto:ncdcdm1@gmail.com)".
-   Right-click on the individual tracker sheet, select "Make a copy", and rename it according to the sprint component ID.
-   In the individual tracker sheet, enter the component ID (e.g., pr03sp01).
-   Copy the OneDrive link to the folder where you created the PPTs for each component and paste it into the individual tracker sheet.
-   Enter all the PPT links for screenshot, marking, and animation PPTs in the individual tracker sheet.
-   Update the individual tracker sheets into the main tracker sheet.
-   Make sure that all tracker sheets have ownership given to "[ncddraq@gmail.com](mailto:ncddraq@gmail.com)" and edit access is given to "[ncdcdm1@gmail.com](mailto:ncdcdm1@gmail.com)".

**Step 4**

To create a PowerPoint presentation for a component:

-  Open OneDrive and navigate to the project folder
-  Find your sprint folder or create a new one if it doesn't exist
-  Create a folder for your component if it doesn't exist already
-  Click "New" and select "PowerPoint presentation"
-  Rename the PowerPoint presentation according to the component ID and type (e.g. 01-Scrsht-pr56sp01-07 for a screenshot PowerPoint)
-  Open the PowerPoint presentation and create slides for the content of the component
-  Save the PowerPoint presentation and upload it to the OneDrive folder for the component
-  Repeat for the other two PowerPoint presentations (marking and animation)
 
**Step 5**

 Create a google photos urls for upload to screenshots images & background editing images

- your senior or head of coordinator will provide you this links

**Step 6**

Check the resources allocate list on content delivery channel and assign a work to particular sprints of project of course

- whenever your become a coordinator to any sprint you must check what is the last update for that sprint, which the last  
task assigned to a team. You can find this in 'daily-sprint-update' from below sheet  
[![](https://developers.google.com/drive/images/drive_icon.png)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsmzZrNEqnyOIS6Vs1l6y54UjaV3h9ag56Gw-ndzpMc/edit?pli=1#gid=1066426619](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsmzZrNEqnyOIS6Vs1l6y54UjaV3h9ag56Gw-ndzpMc/edit?pli=1#gid=1066426619)RESTRICTED CONTENT
- check clearly till how which task its done then plan accordingly which task you have to give to your team.

**Step 7**

Calculate the estimates for based on videos, screenshots & video duration of the sprints of project

- estimations is one of the important task in this. you must be careful when your giving or preparing estimations for  
sprint. In KK of main tracker sheet you find this estimation sheet. You have to do copy of estimation in this  
[![](https://developers.google.com/drive/images/drive_icon.png)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eLvSQAPqR_oSwMjWZPRXFrDlMBm-sWJJ4FyG7U8rOcg/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eLvSQAPqR_oSwMjWZPRXFrDlMBm-sWJJ4FyG7U8rOcg/edit#gid=0)RESTRICTED CONTENT then paste it in KK then  
give the estimations first complete the screen shots task then count all the no. of screen shots enter that in estimation then enter no. of videos then it automatically show you timings then enter how many members are working for which task then it will change time again according to no. of members performing particular task then calculate timings correctly starting to ending and also you must enter date as well.  
- In the estimation just you have to change no. of videos & no. of screen shots, no. of persons working on that task.

**Step 8** 

Post the status update in channel for based on estimates of the sprints of project of course at every 1 hour

-  Sprint-as per estimation - deadline - present working on - difference human-hors - difference in earth-hours

-   sprint is nothing but in which sprint your working as coordinator
    
-   as per the estimation means present which task you have work on as per estimations given
    
-   deadline means task timings in which task your working now presently that task deadline
    
-   different human hours means you have to calculate time with home many members are working in that  
    ex: 1 person is there and that task deadline is 9/6/2021 2 pm but now you are not completes that then 1person * 1 hours= 1 hour
    
-   different in earth hours means calculate the deadline to present timing and enter ex: `status update for p15 - c1_02_mini1`

**Step 9** 

Extract the transcript from videos for animation timestamps

**Step 10**

To create a template with 8 types of slides using a generic template for Course level, follow these steps:

-  Open the generic template PowerPoint file provided by your head coordinator or senior.
-  Click on the "View" tab in the top menu and select "Slide Master."
-  In the left pane, you will see a list of slide masters. Choose the first one and copy it (Ctrl+C).
-  Open your sprint animation PowerPoint file on your desktop and go to the "Slide Master" view.
-  Paste (Ctrl+V) the slide master from the generic template file into your sprint animation PowerPoint file.
-  Delete the old slide masters in your sprint animation PowerPoint file by dragging them up in the left pane.
-  Click on the first slide of the new slide master and press the "Backspace" key to delete the placeholder text and images.
-  Repeat the above steps for all 8 types of slides in the generic template PowerPoint file.
-  Close the "Slide Master" view by clicking on "Close Master View."

Now you can use the new template to create consistent and professional-looking PowerPoint presentations for your sprint components.

**Step 11**

Verify the work compare with videos, google phots and marking ppts

- verify every task carefully, check if it is there any mistakes in the tasks

-   check the screen shots by using video
    
-   verify marking by using video and screen shots, check correctly 4 marking slides are used or not
    
-   verify animation as well with video and marking ppt
    
-   you can verify the tasks easily by using check list which is given below  
    [![](https://developers.google.com/drive/images/drive_icon.png)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v6sZipzR7qA8oN46vovijp0dmcKk0IFEw3ToLxIIZ3g/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v6sZipzR7qA8oN46vovijp0dmcKk0IFEw3ToLxIIZ3g/edit#gid=0)RESTRICTED CONTENT
    
**Step 12**

 List out the mistakes and post the mistakes on leader board

- After completion of verification list that mistakes with person name, what mistake is he/she done,  
and time how is wasted then share with leader board.

**Step 13**

Give report the work hours and work performance to the content delivery head at the end of the day

- Make a list of your team members working hours. If it is there any power cuts, system issues etc.,  
In between of working hours deduct that hours from working hours then share with content delivery head EOD
