#  General stuff about content-delivery

-   Coordinators will update the sprint status in a Google Sheets file called "daily-sprint-progress-updates-v1" https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsmzZrNEqnyOIS6Vs1l6y54UjaV3h9ag56Gw-ndzpMc/edit?pli=1#gid=1066426619 on a daily basis.
-   After updating the file, coordinators will post a Gyazo screenshot of the update to the Slack channel.
-   When a resource finishes an activity, they will post a self-verified checklist.

    2.   @Nikitha Singh,
    3.  please ensure all members post in the required checklist format as we are standardizing it.
    4.  The checklist format has been standardized and should include five important components:
    5.  Checks
    6.  Metrics
    7.  Component IDs
    8.  Status of checks
    9.  Details of metrics
    10.  Here is a sample checklist format:

-   Everyday at 1:30 PM, there will be a handshake call involving all team members from both sides.
-   During the call, the outgoing coordinator will hand over the work to the incoming coordinator.
-   Once the call is completed, the incoming coordinator will acknowledge the work in the Slack channel and take the lead.
-   It is important to note that the handshake time is fixed, and even if the outgoing coordinator is available after the call, the incoming coordinator will be the main coordinator.
-   When working on sprints, it is recommended to maintain the same team members.
-   It is also recommended to allocate familiar sprints to coordinators and team members to avoid too much shuffling across sprints.
-   When giving tasks to team members, each task should have a clearly stated deadline (end time).
-   At the deadline time, the resource is expected to provide a status update along with an expected completion time.

  "  @Sanjeeth Sanju start doing animation instructions for pr30sp01-08 , finish by 4.30PM , if not finished, post a status update with expected finish time at 4.30 PM "
